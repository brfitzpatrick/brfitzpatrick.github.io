	<h1>Homepage of Ben R Fitzpatrick</h1>
	<p>I'm a Research Assistant at the ARC Center of Excellence for Mathematical and Statistical Frontiers based in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology. I'm currently assisting on a variety of applied statistical projects and have recently completed my PhD. My thesis focused on methods for modelling small numbers of geostatistical observations of soil carbon with broad collections of environmental data all available at much finer spatial resolutions than the soil carbon data. The aim of this modelling was to use these high resolution environmental data to assist the interpolation of the soil carbon observations to full cover maps. I am also interested in visualisation methods to communicate predictions from models, the uncertainty associated with these predictions and the mechanics of the models producing these predictions. </p>
