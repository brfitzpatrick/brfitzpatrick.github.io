	<h1>Homepage of Ben R Fitzpatrick</h1>
	<p>2017 has been an exciting year, I completed <a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/112365/">my PhD</a> and <a href="https://bragqut.wordpress.com/2017/12/13/congratulations-dr-earl-duncan-and-dr-ben-fitzpatrick/">graduated</a> in December. I'm moving to Switzerland in January 2018 to begin a postdoc at <a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en.html">The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research</a>. I'll be part of a team investigating natural and anthropogenic influences on the distributions of <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8645/0">red wood ants</a> in Swiss forests.
