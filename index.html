	<p>I'm a postdoc at <a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en.html">The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research</a>. I'm investigating natural and anthropogenic influences on the distributions of <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8645/0">red wood ants</a> in Swiss forests. In 2017 I completed <a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/112365/">my PhD</a> and <a href="https://bragqut.wordpress.com/2017/12/13/congratulations-dr-earl-duncan-and-dr-ben-fitzpatrick/">graduated</a> in December.  Prior to that I studied Zoology and Marine Biology and completed an honours project at the <a href="http://www.meeuwig.org/alumni/#shortcode-alumni4">Centre for Marine Futures in Western Australia</a>.
