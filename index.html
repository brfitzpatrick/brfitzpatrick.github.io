	<h1>Homepage of Ben R Fitzpatrick</h1>
	<p>My PhD Thesis is currently under examination by my external examiners! I'm a PhD Student in the School of Mathematical Sciences at Queensland University of Technology.  I work in Applied Statistics and am interested in applying supervised learning techniques to areas such as digital soil mapping and species distribution modelling (which have more in common methodologically than you might think). I have substantial experience with penalized likelihood methods for implementing coefficient shrinkage (e.g. LASSO, Ridge & Elastic Net regularization) along with binary tree based methods (e.g. Random Forests).</a></p>
