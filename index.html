	<h1>Welcome to the homepage of Ben R Fitzpatrick</h1>
	<p>Hello, I'm a spatial data scientist/quantitative ecologist.  I've worked as a postdoc at <a href="https://www.wsl.ch/en.html">The Swiss Federal Institute for Forest, Snow and Landscape Research</a> where I investigated the influences of <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/8645/0">red wood ant</a> distributions in Swiss forests. Prior to this I completed <a href="https://eprints.qut.edu.au/112365/">my PhD</a> on statistical methods for soil mapping and prior to that I completed an <a href="http://www.meeuwig.org/alumni/#shortcode-alumni4">honours project </a> on species distribution modelling of demersal fishes.
